# Sentinel dVPN
Sentinel dVPN Exit Node - Akash Deployment

## Introduction

This project was created to easily configure and deploy a Sentinel dVPN exit node to the Akash DeCentralized Cloud Compute Marketplace.

## Important Notices:

Plese note that the image contains a default operator address.  This was done in order to automate key creation at install.  This means that it is very important for you to update the deploy.yml file to reflect the name of your key which will be created at deployment.  Understand that everyone with a little know-how has access to this default account.
